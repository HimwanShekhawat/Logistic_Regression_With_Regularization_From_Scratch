# Logistic_Regression_With_Regularization_From_Scratch
This project demonstrates the implementation of logistic regression with L2 regularization using Python and NumPy, without any external machine learning libraries.

## Features
- Logistic regression from scratch
- L2 (Ridge) regularization
- Gradient descent optimization
- Data normalization and visualization
- Decision boundary plotting
- Accuracy evaluation

## Usage
Run the `logistic_regularization.ipynb` notebook to:
1. Load and normalize dataset
2. Train logistic regression model
3. Visualize the cost function and decision boundary
4. Evaluate model performance

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
